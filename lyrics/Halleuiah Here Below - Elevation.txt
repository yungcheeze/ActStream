---[Verse:1]---
We are an altar of broken stones
But You delight in the offering
You have the heavens to call Your home
But You abide in the song we sing
---[Verse:2]---
Ten thousand angels surround Your throne
To bring You praise that will never cease
But hallelujah from here below
Is still Your favourite melody
---[Chorus:1]---
We sing
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
---[Verse:3]---
And should the fire that once burned bright
Become an ember my eyes can't see
I will remember Your sacrifice
I will abide in Your love for me
---[Bridge:1]---
Jesus Christ our King enthroned
All the praise is Yours forevermore
Hallelujah here below
All the praise is Yours forevermore
---[Verse:4]---
Oh, what a wonderful day to come
When every knee bows before Your name
But we will not wait until it does
For here and now shall Your Kingdom reign
