---[Verse:1]---
All these pieces
Broken and scattered
In mercy gathered
Mended and whole
---[Verse:1]---
Empty handed
But not forsaken
I've been set free
I've been set free
---[Chorus:1]---
Amazing grace, How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, But now I'm found
Was blind but now I see
---[Chorus:1]---
Oh I can see you now
Oh I can see the love in Your eyes
Laying yourself down
Raising up the broken to life
---[Verse:2]---
You take our failure
You take our weakness
You set Your treasure
In jars of clay
---[Verse:2]---
So take this heart, Lord
I'll be Your vessel
The world to see
Your life in me
